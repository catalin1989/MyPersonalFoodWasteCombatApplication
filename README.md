# MyPersonalFoodWasteCombatApplication
This is my first java application using the spring boot framework.
I have 3 problemes managing the food in my house.
First probleme: I usualy buy foods and put them in the fridge, freezer or a closet and I forget about them. Some times
I find the items only after they expire or they have mold, so I have to throw them away.
Second probleme: I don't know exactly what foods do I have in stock. Some times I want to cook a dish and I don't know if I 
have a certain ingredient, can't find it and I go and buy it, just to descover latter that I had it.
Third probleme. I buy some groceries, and latter, my wife buys the same groceries, not knowing that I have went to the market.

The application has 4 main functions.
1. I will be able to add foods to a database table(closet, refrigerator, freezer).
2. I will be able to see the foods that are in these storage spaces.
3. I will be able to see the foods that are near they're expiration date.
4. I can send notifications that I have bought some groceries.
